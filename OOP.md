# Objects and Classes

Objects and classes are fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). A **class** serves as a blueprint that defines the **attributes (data/fields)** and **behaviors (methods)** that objects of that type can have. In most programming languages, classes are defined using the `class` keyword.

In OOP, real-world entities are modeled as **objects**. For example, a **phone**, **computer**, **car**, or **animal** can all be considered objects. Each object is an instance of a class and inherits its properties and behaviors.

## Summary

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class with actual data and behavior.

This structure allows software to be more **modular**, **readable**, and **reusable**, making it easier to develop and maintain complex applications.
